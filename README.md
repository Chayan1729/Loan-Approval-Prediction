# Loan Approval Prediction

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to streamline loan approval processes. By leveraging machine learning techniques like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, the model aims to accurately predict loan approval outcomes. This will enable financial institutions to improve efficiency, reduce processing times, and enhance customer experiences.

## Information About the Dataset:

The dataset consists of multiple features related to applicants and their financial and demographic information. These variables are used to determine the likelihood of loan approval.

There are 13 independent variables:

- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- **Gender**: Gender of the applicant (Male/Female).
- **Married**: Marital status of the applicant (Yes/No).
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents the applicant has.
- **Education**: Educational qualification of the applicant (Graduate/Undergraduate).
- **Self_Employed**: Employment type (Self-Employed/Not Self-Employed).
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant's monthly income.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Monthly income of the co-applicant (if applicable).
- **LoanAmount**: Amount of loan requested (in thousands).
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Loan repayment duration (in months).
- **Credit_History**: Record of the applicant's creditworthiness (meets guidelines or not).
- **Property_Area**: Type of property area (Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural).


### Target Variable:

- **Loan_Status**: This is the outcome variable indicating whether the loan application was approved or not.
